## Ahmad Ali Rafique

I am an AI & Machine Learning Specialist with expertise in developing and deploying machine learning models for various applications. With a strong foundation in deep learning, computer vision, and data science, I am dedicated to building innovative solutions that address real-world challenges.

### Project Overview

This repository features a Streamlit-based application designed for real-time helmet detection using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model. The application provides an interactive interface where users can upload images to detect helmets and visualize detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** The YOLOv3 model performs fast and accurate helmet detection in images.
- **User Interface:** Built with Streamlit to offer an easy-to-use interface for image uploads and results display.
- **Visual Feedback:** Provides immediate visual feedback with bounding boxes and confidence scores for detected helmets.
- **Personalized Sidebar:** Includes personal information and contact details for easy connectivity.

### Skills and Technologies Used

- **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web application interface.
- **OpenCV:** For image processing and object detection.
- **NumPy:** For handling numerical operations and manipulating image data.
- **Pillow:** For image handling and processing.

### About the Model

The YOLOv3 model used in this project is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. It has been trained to detect various objects, including helmets, and is capable of real-time detection with high performance.
